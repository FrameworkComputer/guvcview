GTK UVC VIEWER (guvcview)
*************************

Basic Configuration
===================

*Data Files:
------------
(language files; image files; gnome menu entry)

guvcview data files are stored by default to /usr/share
setting a different prefix during configuration will not
change this behavior.
The default value corresponds to most gnome based distros
default, changing it can cause the menu entries to fail.
   
In order to change data files installation base path, the 
variable DATA_DIR must be changed in configure.in and 
autogen.sh shell script must be executed to create a new 
build enviroment.

Built files, src/guvcview and pixmaps/gnome.desktop, are 
dependent on this path, so a make clean is required before
running the autogen.sh script.

After these steps the normal, make | make install should 
build and install all the necessary files.    
    
 
*guvcview bin:
--------------
(src/guvcview)

The binarie file insatll to the standart location,
/usr/local/bin, to change the install path, configure
must be executed with --prefix=DIR set, this will cause
the bin file to be installed in DIR/bin, make sure 
DIR/bin is set in your PATH env variable, or the gnome 
menu entry will fail.


*guvcview.desktop:
------------------

(pixmaps.desktop)

The desktop file (gnome menu entry) is built from
pixmaps/Makefile.am definition and is dependent on 
DATA_DIR, any changes to this file must be done in
pixmaps/Makefile.am, the file must be removed 
(make clean) before building a new one with the 
make command.

Detailed information will be added in future
